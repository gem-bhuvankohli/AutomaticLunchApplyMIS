Hi,

All the processes on MIS portal our interlinked and we spend some of our time doing certain tasks
which are redundant and not necessary. 

For example,
Consider a scenario where I have applied lunch for a particular date and due to some reason
I have to take leave on that day. So, when I go on MIS portal to apply for leave i have to deselect
my lunch for that day as well which we can forget or in any case is unnecessary and should be 
done automatically after I have applied a leave.

Considering the above problem statement in mind I have built an automated script for a start
which allows us to automatically apply lunch on one click.

Features:
1. Authentication and log in via SSO
2. Completely built with selenium using java
3. Minimal Code
4. Allows quick and automatic lunch apply for all dates
5. Vast scope of improvement
6. Multiple add-on features like request, WFH, LWP can also be integrated.
   
Limitations(as of now):
1. Currently not working for specific dates, applies for all dates.
2. Specific to Cannan Tower(Can be changed by adding scanner and user input).
3. Unable to detect and fetch whether user data if she/he is on WFH and doesn't require lunch.(logic can be built)
4. Doesn't have the deselect dates feature(yet).

Future scope of improvements: 
1. Can be made faster and efficient by integrating it with API automation.
2. Can be made more user specific and friendly. For example, allowing user to enter specific date and location.
3. Feature can be added where if a person applies for WFH, then that lunch for that date gets automatically deselected.             

      
Hence, many redundant tasks on MIS can be avoided along with wastage of food can also be reduced
by using this script. Although it does work fine and fulfills the automatic lunch apply feature, but it has
a lot of scope and multiple improvements and integration of multiple MIS features can also be included 
here.

I would appreciate really appreciate any feedbacks and improvements on how can we make this better
and solve multiple problems.
